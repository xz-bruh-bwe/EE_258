Find and download the dataset: https://www.vision.caltech.edu/datasets/cub_200_2011/

1. Make sure that all of the necesary libraries are downloaded before the code runs.

2. Make sure the datasets is in the same directory folder as the .ipynb submitted with this README file

3. Navigate to cell 8 "import the dataset"
    Assign the dataset_loc = "your desired path where the dataset is"

4. Finally, within the jupyter terminally, individually run each cell. 

Warning: Run each cell individually because some of the code is computationally intensive and will take a long while.
